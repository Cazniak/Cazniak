Hi, I'm @Cazniak (Dylan Cahill)

I’m interested in Electrical Engineering and am currently completing my Bachelor of Electrical and Electronic Engineering at University of Newcastle, Callaghan.

I'm currently working on a robot that plays beer pong using stereo computer vision for my final year project at University of Newcastle and hope to develop the project to the point where it can be used as an interactive display at the university's open days to attract potential students to Electrical Engineering.
